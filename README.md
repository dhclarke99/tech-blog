## Description

This application is a website for viewing, posting, and interacting with blogs of any topic. Users are able to create an account, post their own blogs, and comment on any posted blogs from other users. 

Building this app gave me valuable experience with creating a full-stack backend application combining node js, express js and handlebars js, along with a mysql database.
